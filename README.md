# Javascript_zero-hero 	:computer:
Javascript_zero-hero is a complete reference for learning javascript from absolute beginner to advanced. I have created projects with vanilla javascript only; no external library or plugins are used.
Every concept is covered as I can.

Feel free to add new projects to this repository

 

## How to use this file
1. Every folder contain a stater file and final file 
2. Refer final file and do along on the starter file. (starter file is empty folder structure created for you)
3. This resource is purely structured based on the project. So you will do many projects as you go!
4. Run the final file to see projects live before you start coding

The code is well documented so that you can understand every thing clearly.

So folks, get ready and excited and start coding. :star_struck: :sunglasses:
